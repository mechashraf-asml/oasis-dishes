Chicken Tikka is the essential dish whenever we do BBQ with friends here.

Quantity
Applicable for 1 kg of chicken with Bone/Boneless. Don’t forget to remove the skin otherwise charcoal fire will burn the spices and meat(as happened to me last time) 

Ingredients
Salt - 1 tsp
Red Chili - 1 tsp
Paprika - 1/2 tsp
Turmeric - 1/2 tsp
Star Aniseed - 1
Cinnamon - 1 small pc
Cumin Brown - 2 tsp
Cardamom - 2/3 pcs
Black Pepper - 1/2 tsp
Coriander powder - 1 tsp
Ginger - 1 inch grounded
Garlic - 2/3 cloves
Dried Papaya Powder - 1/2 tsp
Citric Acid or Lemon - 1/2 tsp
Vinegar – 1/2 tsp
Cooking oil - few spoons

* Increase/decrease spice quantity as per your own taste

How to make:

1. Ground all the solid spices into powder form (easy to apply and spices does not drop in the charcoal).
2. Mix all the spices with oil.
3. Cut the chicken into pieces.
4. Apply some cuts(like in picture) to chicken.
5. Marinate the spice mix with chicken and leave for atleast 2 hours.
6. BBQ on charcoal, avoid fire contact with chicken to prevent spices from burning.
7. Serve with Nan/Pita Bread, garnish with fresh coriander for enhanced taste.

Tip: The list of spices is a bit long. If you find it difficult to find all the ingredients (or expensive to buy all the spices for just 1 or 2 times usage), buy ‘National Chicken tikka masala’ or ‘Shan Chicken tikka masala’ from any South Asian store, sometimes also from Turkish store.
