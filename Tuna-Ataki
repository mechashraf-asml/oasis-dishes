Preparation:
Start with the sauce. Cut the onion into small cubes and fry in olive oil with the bay leaves. Add some balsamic vinegar and cook over low heat for 15 minutes. Add the tomato pulp and a spoon of sugar and simmer for 45 minutes.

Make the vinaigrette with lemon, soy sauce, olive oil and sesame. No real measurements, just taste, but don't be shy with the sesame seeds.

Cut the eggplant into thin slices and fry in olive oil. 
Also fry the arugula in olive oil.
Also sear the tuna cubes on both sides in hot olive oil for a few moments.

When the tuna has cooled a bit, you can cut it into 2 cm thick slices.

Pour a bottom of sauce onto a plate and place the cooked eggplant on top. Arrange the tuna on top and decorate with the fried arugula. Finish with the vinaigrette.
Optional add some wasabi mayonnaise to the plate.

Story:
Trying to cook new stuff for me and my wife reguallary, and this tasted better than expected.
Also I still had a picture of this dish. I think I have some more recipes to share. However, I currently don’t have any pictures of other dishes and also the recipes have to be translated…
